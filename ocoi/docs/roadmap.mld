{0 OCaml On Ice roadmap}
Various minor possible improvements are listed in the source code in [TODO] comments. Others will likely occur or be planned as I use the framework. Some larger planned features:
- Types and query/controller generation to specify relationships between models
- Code generation for integrated ReasonML/React frontend projects
- Allowing deployment with FastCGI rather than as a standalone server

Contributions are very welcome!
