Basic dune question:
I want this directory structure:
```
/a
  /b
    /c
      d.ml
    b.ml
  /e
    f.ml
```
where `f.ml` should be able to access `b.ml` as `B` and `d.ml` as `B.C.D`, and `d.ml` uses code from `b.ml`. What do I
need in the dune files to make this work? I tried various things but couldn't find a setup that exposed `D` to `f.ml`
and didn't cause a circular dependency between `b.ml` and `d.ml`.
