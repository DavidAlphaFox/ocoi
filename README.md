# OCaml On Ice

OCaml On Ice is a planned web framework in the style of Ruby on Rails or Django, but in OCaml. Initially it will be a
wrapper around [Opium](https://github.com/rgrinberg/opium) plus some code generation tools. It is designed primarily for
building REST APIs, and in particular REST APIs to be used as backends for web apps with frontends written in ReasonML.

## Quickstart
Create a new project using `ocoi new`. This will have the following structure:
```
/app
    /models
    /controllers
    /db
    main.ml
```

## Features
